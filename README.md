# Duckietown
Welcome to the home of my CMPUT 412 (Experimental Mobile Robotics) projects. This repository contains code that will be written for autonomous vehicles known as "duckiebots". This course builds on top of the [Duckietwon](https://www.duckietown.org/) learning platfrom, serving as an introduction to the fundamentals of autonomous robotics.

# Repository structure
At the root-level of this repository, you will notice that there are a set of folders coresponding to each "exercise" that I completed as part of the CMPUT 412 curriculum. Many exercises will be further subdivided into "units." Where applicable, you can use the README files nested in the exercises and units to better understand the code that they contain.

Any code that is intended to be runnable by others will have instructions for doing so. At this time, no such code exists.

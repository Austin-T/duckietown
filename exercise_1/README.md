# Exercise 1
In this exercise I learned the basic knowledge and skills needed to operate a
Duckiebot, including robot assembly, networking, scripting, containerization, version control, and more.

This directory contains code that spans a set of exercises (B-2, B-5, and B-6) from the book *Hands On Robotics Development using Duckietown.*

# Exercise 3: Computer Vision for Robotics
This exercise provided an introduction to computer vision and localization in robotics. It builds on top of the deadreckoning techniques developed in exercise 2, using fiducial markers to enable better pose estimation in the environment.

For solutions to part 1.1 of the exercise, please visit `packages/augmented_reality_basics` and `packages/augmented_reality_apriltag`

For solutions to part 1.2 of the exercise, please visit `packages/apriltag_detector`

For solutions to part 2 of the exercise, please visit `packages/lane_following`

The remainder of the exercise has code that spans both `packages/apriltag_detector` and `packages/deadreckoning`
